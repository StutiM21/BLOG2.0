BLOG2.0 is a site where the user can read your posts based on the categories and they can also subscribe to the newsletters. This website uses features of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to give desired visuals and features to the site. We have used buttons, cards, columns, rows etc to make this blogging website visually more attractive. Everytime the user will refresh the page image will change in the default, categories and search page since it uses a image URL that gives out random images. More effects such as the blur and opacity effects while using the toggle button make it easier to use on mobile phones as well, Overall the website is very user interactive and can be easily used.
